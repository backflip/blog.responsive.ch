See https://community.fly.io/t/how-to-copy-files-off-a-vm/1651/7

Use `scp` or a GUI like `Transmit` to connect to `root@localhost` on port `10022`.

Copy files from `/app` to `/app-temp`

Make sure `/app-temp/fathom` has the same permissions as `/app/fathom`

```toml
[mounts]
  source = "fathom"
  destination = "/app"
```
