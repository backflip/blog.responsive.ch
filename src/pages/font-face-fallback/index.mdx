abstract: Using <code>capsize</code> to minimize the impact of custom web fonts on cumulative layout shift.
---

Using custom fonts with reasonable [swapping behavior](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@font-face/font-display) may cause to the fallback font being to be visible before the custom font is loaded. Depending on the size difference between the two fonts, this can lead to layout shifts that are very annoying to users. And it negatively affects performance measurement metrics like [Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)](https://web.dev/articles/cls).
