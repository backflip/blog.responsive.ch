After deciding to write more blog posts (heavily inspired by [Jim Nielsen](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com) and [Simon Willison](https://simonwillison.net)), the first step was crystal clear: Replace the underlying framework so the actual writing part can be postponed.

As a responsible web developer, I'm obligated to spend at least 75% of my time evaluating new JavaScript frameworks. And there is no better way to do this than using them on ~~important customer~~ personal projects. When setting this blog up two years ago, [Gastby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com) was shiny. It worked out fine as I learned the valuable lesson that it is probably over-engineered for most things.

Getting back to it after more than a year and on a computer with a different processor architecture, I was obviously unable to run `npm install` without twenty-five football fields of errors and warnings. As Gatsby had most probably been rewritten from the ground up, repeatedly, in the meantime, upgrading to the latest version would have taken some time anyway. So I picked a new shiny object: [Astro](https://astro.build).

I had been closely following Astro's development and very much sympathized with its general philosophy:

> [...] cover a wide range of styles in the noise field, from space music to psychedelically-tinged harsh noise

Never mind, [wrong Astro](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astro_(Japanese_band)>). This one here:

> Zero JavaScript Runtime. Astro renders HTML on the server and strips away any remaining, unused JavaScript.

Now you might think this is irrelevant for a blog with zero client-side JavaScript to begin with. Great thinking! However, there are frameworks whose main purpose is to generate JavaScript out of no JavaScript so they can send it to the visitors of your website because they hopefully are JavaScript afficionados, too.

{/* (As it is stable, well-documented and well-known among developers I'm working with, I'm still using Next.js on many of my professional projects. But [Alex Russell](https://twitter.com/slightlylate)'s twitter feed started wearing me down and watching parts of [this self-adulation](https://nextjs.org/conf) didn't help either.) */}

### Takeaways

1. Installing it is fun already, thanks to [Nate Moore](https://twitter.com/n_moore/status/1567164215307149312)'s amazing work. [^1]
